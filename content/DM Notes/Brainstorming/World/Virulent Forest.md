# Notes
- Normally a magical forest with unknown magical creatures and hazards within. Most parties that venture into the [[Virulent Forest]] are never heard from again.
- Occasionally magical beasts will prowl out of the [[Virulent Forest]] and new [[Kalos]] in search of food. The great walls of [[Kalos]] are the only thing that keep these kinds of creature at bay.
- [[Lavender Web]] are one of the creatures that inhabit the forest.
- The unnatural behavior of the trees is due to corruption from the void.

# Notes
- A type of tree within the [[Virulent Forest]] that preys on people and warm blooded creatures.
- The tree has a main trunk, and branches up for about 12 feet before spreading branches down all around it. There are thin branches interwoven between the main branches in a web like fashion. Long small red hairs stretch from all exposed bark and act as the trees method of sensing things.
- These trees can grow at an incredible rate and spear living things with its branches to deposit its seeds in the persons blood stream. The seeds use the nutrients in the creature to grow, slowly spreading roots through the person. When the person dies a new [[Lavender Web]] grows from their corpse.
- These trees are normal trees mutated by the void.

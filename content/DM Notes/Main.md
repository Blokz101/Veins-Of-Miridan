## Plot
- [[Assassination mission]]
- [[Escape from Hell]]
- [[Journey though the Magical Wastes]]

## Random Ideas
- Turn timer of 30 seconds to declare an action. Each party member can call a specific number of timeouts to discuss if they want.
- Logarithmic curve to reusable damage?
- Wizards Nerf: Wizards cannot cast the same combat related non cantrip spell more than once per encounter after they have successfully hit it.
- Combat does not happen in turns or by initiative, instead the players and monsters roll initiative and one side or the other goes first. On the players turn the players can go in whatever order they want and weave their actions together however they want. Same for the monsters. 
- When a member of the party dies they can choose to come back or not, if they choose to return they get a curse because their soul is not meant to have returned.
	- Every round of combat for each curse a player has, they roll a d20. If their roll is lower or equal to the number of curses they have they roll on a table of curses and the effect lasts a round or two.
- Give arcane signets levels that they work indefinitely for. For example a lv2 arcane signet allows the casting of level two and below spells without need for spell components.
- Each long rest should progress events in the world and will be the consequence of taking long rests.
- When a player channels power though a stone their eyes turn blue. If they channel a sufficiently great amount of power through a stone then their eyes start to glow blue. After not channeling power their eyes fade back to their original color. 

Weave Stones (different ways to cut a weave stone)

## Plot Ideas 
- Old Ideas
	- Ten years ago a new vein of rock called etherium was discovered in the world of Miridan. The stones are quickly dubbed weave stones in the common tongue. This stone provided a unique ability to control the flow of energy though the world to the person who held one. From these rocks all forms of magic were born, specifically the abilities described in the DND classes and spell lists. Barbarians channeled the energy to fuel their rage, Rogues gained supernatural stealth by reading the flow of energy though the rocks to decipher what might give them away. Etc. The kingdoms of Miridan fought to obtain the rare rocks for the powers they bestowed. 
	- The DND party will begin the campaign as part of the war for the kingdom Eldoria against the kingdom Syntharis. The first session the party will meet one of the main antagonists on a mission to assassinate him. They will be given info about him that leads them to believe that he is not a powerful on his own, but when they confront him they will realize its a trap. During this fight an NPC with the part will shatter their mana rock to open a portal out so the party can escape certain death. However, the antagonist, who is secretly a demon will subtly alter the portals magic so it sends them to the third level of hell instead of back out into the real world. The party will begin the first part of the campaign trapped in hell trying to escape. 

- At first there was nothing, the pure mental realm was a dark and oblivious thing. In it dwelled creatures called the Watchers. They were perfect embodiments of intelligence, forever unused and unaware even of their own sentience. Then came the physical realm and the creatures that lived in within it. Creatures in the physical realm manifested simple ghostly consciousness in the mental realm and filled it with noise, pain, experience, and emotion. With nowhere to flee to escape the something, the Watchers came to the conclusion that the something had to be extinguished. However, to extinguish the something, the Watchers needed agents, a method of control in the something. To achieve this one Watcher bridged the gap between the void and the something to pull material into the void for study and use. As soon as the Watcher touched the physical realm it changed. It became something, manifested a body, and was forever ripped from the void. Before it was completely taken though, it managed to break off large chunks of matter and push it, or at least the idea of it, into the void. The Watchers in the void were then able to infuse bits of the void into the matter and create mental links with their new constructs, the Voidspawn. The chunks of matter that were tossed into the void was the city of Icathica and a chunk of ocean next to it. In pulling the void near enough to the physical realm to pass though, The First Watcher also mixed the void and consious creatues born of the physical realm, creating something new and unintentional, Nymeria. Nymeria is a creature born of consciousness of the physical creatures pulled into the void, a thing hungry for experience. It seeks to experience everything, and in so doing reshape the world behind it to its desires. The lands it consumes are known as the Maroon Estate.
- There are three main forces at work in Miridan
	- The Watchers and the Void
		- The Watchers are the oldest creatures. They existed with the Void before there was anything, living in peace, silence, and nothingness. 
		- The Watchers are currently imprisoned in true ice at the bottom of what is known as the Abyss deep within the frosty lands of Iskalla.
		- The Watchers are able to use the material still in their realm to create the void born. These creatures are the agents of the void and carry out the voids destructive plans.
	- Nymeria and it's Levander Sea
		- Nymeria seeks to experience everything it can and add to its Levander Sea.
		- Will show up later in the campaign, but will be causing mysterious things to happen around the world. Things that the party can assume the void had something to do with, but things that do not seem in line with the voids motives.
	- Halvard and the Kingdom of Kalos
		- Seeks to create the largest army it can to ensure its survival admits a mysterious world of predators. 
		- The players will start their adventure here and immediately be exposed to the greed of the Kingdom. Their first mission will be one to overthrow the Cobble Mining Colony and discover the corruption within.
- The more powerful the Weave Stone the more it corrupts the wielder.

World name: Miridan

## Spell Ideas
- Ice spells?
	- Blast a cone of freezing air and water outwards from the caster in a 45 degree 15 foot cone. The water freezes into jagged icicles and a creature moving into the sharp ends takes 1d10 of damage for every 5 feet they move. 

## Magic Item Ideas
- Magic sword or bow or railgun where instead of making attacks with it, it deals damage in a 5ft radius cylinder directed outwards from the player.
- Shield that can charge and release energy. When an attack is declared to hit the wielder, that player can use their reaction to brace with the shield. They make a dex check with the DC being the number used for the attack roll. If they succeed they take half damage and the shield gains a charge counter (charge counters until next long rest). Once per long rest, when hit by an attack you may activate the shield:
	- Let X be the number of charge counters on the shield.
	- 0 charges: You take half damage from the attack.
	- 1 charge: A blast of kinetic energy sweeps out from the shield. Each creature in a 15 degree 15 foot cone make a dexterity saving throw DC 10+2X. On a failed save a creature takes Xd6 force damage or half as much on a successful one.
	- 2 charges: Creatures who failed the dexterity save are knocked back 5X feet.
	- 4 charges: You take no damage from the attack. Additionally if the attack against you was a ranged attack and physical in nature, the projectile is blasted back towards the attacker with the same attack roll and damage.
- Ring that effectively wildshapes the wearer.
- Ring that suppresses magic. The wearer could use a spell slot and action to try to overload the ring and break it. The higher the spell slot the greater advantage they should have to break the ring.
- A Darkin Weapon that the players hear about and can search for. If they find it and decide to attune to it, it will draw their soul into the weapon and lock it there for all eternity.

## Encounter Ideas
- Players are trying to gain entry to a place, to do so they must research and find a secret tunnel. While traversing the tunnel they get ambushed by assassins, the leader of which has [[Assassins Dagger]].
- Place with mirrors and some source that is constantly blasting Sunbeam in a direction. Mirrors can be used to redirect Sunbeam.
- While the party is in a group situation have a fight break out between agents of two of the major three factions above. The players should have minimal information and do whatever they want to.
- Have a villain who is really weak but uses thaumaturgy and minor illusion to make himself seem much more powerful.
- Living magical storm that feeds on magic. Think highstorm? Targets party members with rocks and roams the land leaching the magic out of everything it can.
- A desert with a whirlpool that drops players straight into the void.
## General DMing Things
- Plan specific descriptions. Split information into free, hidden, and secret information.

## Other Ideas
- Keep a table of random loot for random looting things.
- Make the world not revolve around the players, NPCs should have their own agendas that they are attempting to carry out and the players should run into them.
- Make a character sheet for each NPC.
- Plan out rooms in advance, passive perception should be used to uncover things like better gear. Encourage players to explore and interact with the world past just progression.
- Use level up by xp, players will need to spend some time exploring and participating in NPC things to get strong enough to challenge bosses. 
	- The bosses should not scale down to the players.
- Players can roll perception on players or monsters, depending on their roll they receive an approximation of the creatures stats and abilities. Have a program calculate this. Set different DC checks for different abilities and an increasingly random mod for stats depending on how bad the roll was.
- Some kind of interesting resource scarcity?
- Some kind of omnipresent threat. Maybe like wraiths or some kind of magical monster that is attracted by death? An trap in the wild could be some trigger that kills 10 rats thus attracting the wraiths?
- UNDERWATER COMBAT!!!!
- Introduce a second objective into combat for either the players or the monsters.
	- Stop a spell from being cast
	- Protect a party member
	- Destroying an object
	- Solve a puzzle to stop waves of enemies
- Introduce new monsters in the middle of combat.
- Make sure to move at least half of the monsters each round.
- Add monsters with different fighting styles (ranged, melee, casters, strong, weak, etc)
- Keep the terrain changing during the battle.
	- Difficult terrain
	- Cover
	- Sight
	- Inaccessible terrain
	- Knockdown
	- Ensnaring
	- Movable and Unmovable obstructions
- Maybe add a floating wandering city?

### New Mechanics
A main goal of this campaign for me is to keep DND as dynamic and creative as possible, so we will be experimenting with new mechanics to make the entire campaign as fun as possible.

- #### New Spells and Abilities
	- The spells and abilities in the Player Handbook are not the end of magic and skill. The spells, class features, and even classes in the Player Handbook simply represent what is common knowledge at the start of the campaign. Those who specialize in their arts are sure to have discovered more.
	- When a spell or ability is used that a player does not recognize, the players who saw the effect can roll an `Intelligence Check`, `Wisdom Check`, or `Arcana Check`, depending on the spell or ability, to learn how it works. 
	- Spells and abilities that the party learn about will be posted in the World section of this document afterwards for ease of access.
- #### Creating New Spells and Abilities
	- Characters can spend time practicing with their bow or pouring over old runes to learn new skills or invent new spells.
	- To start creating a new spell or ability tell me what your character is trying to create. Then your character must spend a total of 24 hours working on the new skill or ability. This time does not and should not be consecutive. For example a character might put in three hours of practice before getting ready to rest for the night. At the end of the 24 hours the player rolls an appropriate skill check and I will provide you with the details of what your character has created.
	- Based on the roll and what your character could plausibly achieve the new spell or ability may do some, all, or none of what you intended. If your character is not happy with the result,  they can continue work on the spell or ability for another 24 hours and roll again.
	- I want to add some creation process for the players characters can truly be unique. That being said I am not in the business of trying to balance all these spells so please don't try to metagame with this. For example, if you try to create a spell similar to power word kill as a level 7 character you will fail.

### Altered Mechanics
To better fit the magical systems of [[Miridan]] some aspects of the beloved Player Handbook need to be altered. Rules below take president over the Player Handbook, if something is not mentioned, default to the Player Handbook.

- #### Ability Checks and Saving Throws
	- Some `Ability Checks` and `Saving Throws` can have an extra two tiers of performance based on the table below.
		- **Full Success** occurs when the creature rolls above or equal to the $DC+2$.
		- **Half Success** occurs when the creature rolls above or equal to $DC$.
		- **Half Failure** occurs when the creature rolls above or equal to $DC-2$.
		- **Full Failure** occurs when the creature rolls below all the others.
	- The goal for this is to make some spells and abilities, new or old, feel less bad if the effect does not land. For these spells its harder to get a full success, but its also harder to completely waste your turn and spell slot.
- #### Arcane Signets
	- Arcane Signets can only exist as a spell casters [[_Weave Stone|Weave Stones]] which has been specially crafted to allow for the creation of components. Spell casters [[_Weave Stone|Weave Stones]] will contain a field `Arcane Signet Level` which determines the maximum spell level that it can create physical components for.

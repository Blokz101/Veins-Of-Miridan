- ## Notes
	- A forest completely controlled by the plants.
	- A forest that is composed of what appears to be many plants but is actually one tree hive mind. All the plants are connected together by networks of roots under the ground.
	- The plants of this forest bear fruits with glowing seeds. Any creature that eats the seeds gains a telepathic link with the tree mind. Once this link is established the trees can dominate almost any creature and indoctrinate them into the hive mind.

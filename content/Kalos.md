# History
- Before the discovery of [[Oculardenite|Oculite]], [[Kalos]] was a small settlement partially inside a cave. The single opening made it easy to defend even for creatures without [[Magic]].
- The rise of [[Kalos]]
	- When [[Oculardenite|Oculite]] was discovered deep in the caves of [[Kalos]], the game changed. The [[Civilized Races]] now had access to [[Magic]].
	- Despite their new powers, the citizens of [[Kalos]] were still no match for the magical beasts of the [[Virulent Forest]]. What they did have though is coordination and teamwork. Large teams of citizens could work together to fend off attackers that would ordinarily kill the isolated person.
	- Sick of their status at the bottom of the food chain a group gathered, now known and founded the [[The Rangers Guild]]. Their goal was to claim space in the [[Virulent Forest]] by constructing massive magical walls to protect their newly budding kingdom.
	- After long and tedious fights [[The Rangers Guild]] was successful in staving off the magical beasts long enough for a group of 10 specially gifted mages to weave their creation spell. This group of 10 would become known as [[The First Citizens]].

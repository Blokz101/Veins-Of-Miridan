- ## Notes
	- Spiders that weave ethereal webs that can inflict terrible nightmares. 
	- The web sticks to a creature that passes though it and at night the spider can torment the creature and drain their vitality. Webs deteriorate as the spider channels energy though them, and so only last one night.

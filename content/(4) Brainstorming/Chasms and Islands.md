- ## Notes
	- Locations where the ground drops away to unfathomable depths and islands are floating above normal ground levels.
	- This combination of chasm and island is caused by a high concentration of [[Oculardenite]] in the islands. The large scale patterns of the [[Oculardenite]] channel the [[Weave]] into an upwards force on the islands from below. 
	- These formed a long time ago where massive veils of [[Oculardenite]] met in specific geometrical patterns. These patterns channeled the [[Weave]] into creating massive upwards forces in chunks of the ground. Eventually the ground ripped upwards. The specific geometry of [[Oculardenite]] determined the force applied on it. Some chunks of rock had enough force to be launched into space, others didnt and simply fell into the crater. A specific few were able to stabilize into what are now floating islands above a chasm.

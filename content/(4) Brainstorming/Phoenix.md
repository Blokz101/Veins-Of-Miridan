- ## Notes
	- Independent, intelligent, long lived birds that seem to be wreathed in constant flame. When they die the fire consumes them and as long as their ashes remain within close proximity of each other they are reborn. 
	- It is unknown how phoenixes were created, and they are unable to produce offspring. Permanently killing a Phoenix is considered a horrible crime in the animal kingdom.

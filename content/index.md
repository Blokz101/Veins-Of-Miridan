Welcome to the Veins of Miridan homepage! This document will act as a lore document, session history, item catalog, and creature catalog. Check below before each session for pre-session information and or announcements.

This campaign does not take place in Faerun, so descriptions, locations, and mechanics may vary. Use the 5e handbook as default, but check [[Rulings]] for updated mechanics and use the rest of this document for world information.

World information as your characters know it and as is generally known in [[Kalos]] is accessible via the links below. However, just because something cannon does not mean it is fact, it is simply the best knowledge your character currently has. As you explore [[Miridan]] links and notes will update with the new information.
